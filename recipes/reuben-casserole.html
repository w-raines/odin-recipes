    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tasty Reuben casserole with layers of sauerkraut, corned beef, Swiss cheese, rye bread crumbs, and Russian-style salad dressing is like a baked deli sandwich in a dish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices rye bread, cubed</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can sauerkraut, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 pound deli sliced corned beef, cut into strips</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup Russian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Spray one sheet of aluminum foil with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Spread bread cubes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer bread cubes with sauerkraut and beef strips, then pour dressing over top. Cover with the aluminum foil, sprayed-side down.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove and discard foil; sprinkle Swiss cheese over casserole. Continue baking until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 10 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
