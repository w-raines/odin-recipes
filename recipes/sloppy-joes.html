    <p>Fast and easy! These sloppy joes are a sure winner. The main ingredients are ground beef and chili sauce; you probably have the rest on hand. Only 5 ingredients go from in the pot to on the table super fast!</p>

        <li>3 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped celery</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) bottle tomato-based chili sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="ugly">
        <li>Crumble ground beef into a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until evenly browned. Drain off grease.</li>
        <li>Add onion and celery to ground beef in the pot. Cook and stir until onion is tender, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and pour in chili sauce. Stir in vinegar, sugar, and mustard. Simmer until mixture reaches desired thickness.</li>
